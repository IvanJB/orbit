# orbit
CSS3 Animation of the Earth rotating around the Sun shadow by the Moon.
Goal of the animation is to create a Flash based animation with key frames just using HMTL5 and CSS3.
Soon to be unsupported Flash will force designers to understand the front and back end of coding 
a simple or complex animation sequence using png, jpg, or full vector svg format.
